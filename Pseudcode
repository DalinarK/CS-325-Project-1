Algorithm 1

var maxSum

For i in Array
{
	For j in Array - j will start out to be + 1 of i
	{
		Sum values from i to j (this is a for loop... so O(N^3)?
		Compare sum to maxSum. 
			If it is bigger, change maxSum and continue to next j
	}
}

Algorithm 2

var maxSum 
var currentSum
For i in Array
{
	set current sum to the first value of array, which is i. 
	For j in Array - j will start out to be + 1 of i
	{
		currentSum = j + currentSum (this is not a for loop... so O(N^2)?
		Compare sum to maxSum, if it is bigger change maxSum

	}
}
